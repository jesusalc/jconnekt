How Security is achieved in the Web Services
-----------------------------------------------
No Mater which protocol used (REST,XMLRPC,SOAP) the security is done as below...

1.some one can argue interoperatbility might get vanished achieving security in 
  our own way.. But there are 2 reasons/answers
     1.This is not a mission critical app.. so we don't need much heavy security
     2.We are creating JConnect API so developers directly don't have to worry
       about security.. (so interopratibility doesn't affected)
       
How we do this
---------------------
1.We have to maintain 3 properties
   1.Authentication
   2.Integrity
   3.Confidentiality
   
2.Authentication and Integrity can be achieve using HMAC coz we are already shared
  a secret key..
3.Confidentiality only need for passwords ...
  So we use AES (mcrypt or AES class)

Authentication and Integrity
-----------------------------
1.In the caller (class Joomla and ExApp) generated hmac-md5 version by concatanating
  arguments in the message... and sends the message and the hmac code.
2.in the server it also generate the hmac-md5 from the message and verify it with given one..
3.the return values also sends with a hmac-md5 code.
4.in the caller it generates the hmac-md5 from the message and verify...
5.in objects and arrays hmac-md5 generation done in the basis of objects'/arrays' JSON
6.for the passwords we used encrypted one. 

Confidentiality
------------------
1.Passwords are always encrypt with AES and send in the webservice (by caller)
2.Reciver it should get decrypted..

KEYS USING
--------------
1.We use seperate keys for HMAC and AES
2.But we transfer it as a one.. 
   as like this : 
     $secKey=HMAC_KEY::AES_KEY
