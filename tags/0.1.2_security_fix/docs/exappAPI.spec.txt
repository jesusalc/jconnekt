ExApp API structure..
--------------------------------
ExApp API is in 2 forms...
 1.Function can be used by developer..(Joomla function,authentication)
 2.Functions need to be developed by developer.. (for exApp server..)
 
2.Developer Functions...
----------------------------
Developers have to extend a class and implement those functions..
3 classes tobe extends... basis of their work..
 1.JCUserSync - do the user-sync stuff..
    *deleteUser
    *getUserCount
    *getUserDetails
    *getUserGroups
    *getUsers
 2.JCMisc
    *getPrivateView
    *getPublicView
    *loadSysInfo

After creating those class developer has to go to api-folder and add these created classes to the JCFactory.. (can do this in settings.php)
