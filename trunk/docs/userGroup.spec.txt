User Group Specs...
--------------------------
1.map exApps user-groups with joomla acl usergroups...(for incoming)
2.map joomla user groups with exApp usergroups for outgoing...

Incoming
--------------------
1.when do incoming we only change the state update user-group when updating user if 
  the perticular user is owned by that app...
  (this is used coz it's not fair to change user-level by other applications)
  eg:- if a existing joomla admin synced with elgg then when updationg elgg user the existing
       joomla users group updated as elgg mapping (could be downgraded)...
2.when doing sync or conflicts groups chages normally...
3.when creating new user groups will be done normally...

Outgoing
----------------------
1.We've only controlling users which are not owned by ExApp...
2.We are sending null as userGroup for ExApp owned users...
3.For others we do as it should be...
4.The only place where we are sending userGroup is when user login using JConnect..
  In there userGroup is travel in SREG field 'country'
