New Authentication Layer (OpenID Like..)
-----------------------------------------------------

High-end how-to
----------------------
1.from exApp send a request to Joomla with a callback URL...(include nonce) and
  the exApp name.. (stores the nonce even)
2.Then joomla do the actual login stuff....
3.If success joomla create a public key/private key and redirect the callback URL
  with the public key..
4.In the mean-time joomla stores the private-key with the timestamp and isUsed fields
5.Then in the ExApp it's call a fopen call to Joomla with the private key
  (generated using public-key) as the args
6.In there it'll check the private-keys validity and send the information

back-end how-to
-----------------------------
1.controller to do the login
2.create the table
3.private-key,public-key generation
4.create the private-key request function
5.modify elgg to do-auth

NEW Authentication token procedure
-------------------------------------
1. Register ExApp with Joomla for the browser session (sending a redirect with appName)
2. Joomla send a (token + user_state) and store it in DB and cookie or session
3. ExApp validate it with it's private key and store it in the browser and take neccessory actions
5. if some user action changes in Joomla or valid time exeeded that token will be discarded
6. elgg can query for the token for it's existance
7. if it's not there that means something has happens.
8. Goto step 1 

	If JConnekt Login is done using ExApp it'll send the token as a return
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	So then after that ExApp needs to continue from above step 3
	
	Joomla side modification
	--------------------------
	Make DB Changes
	add plugin hooks for destroy tokens when user-action changing
	Create endpoint actions (register,validate_token,check_token,query)
	
	Elgg side modifcations
	--------------------------
	add a api method to validate_token,check_token and query
	1. if there is no cookie saying jconnekt_token redirect browser to joomla to get a one
	2. and validate_token with the joomla againts shared key 
	3. if comes with login=true query with token and get neccessory details and do the login
	4. keep on checking check_token for it's failure.
	5. goto step 1
