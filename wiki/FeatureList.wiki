=== Fully User Synchronization between joomla and ExApp ===
Once You've installed and configured JConnekt correctly with an External Application (ExApp) You can use this feature. and it's automatically activated!. 
What this does is 
 * If you create a new user Joomla that user can be used to logged into ExApp
 * And JConnekt make sure that user is synced with ExApp 
 * So that you can update user-details from ExApp and chages will apply to all the ExApps and to the Joomla
 * And the vise-versa of this  case is also the true 

=== Bulk Synchronization ===
  *Before you installed JConnekt there could be users available in both Joomla and in the ExApp. 
  *So this will help you to synchronize existing users in both ExApps and Joomla.
  *And it's possible to have username conflicts and way to manage those conflicts is also provided.

=== Cross Domain Single SignIn and SignOut ===
 * It's always tricky and hard to work with Cross domain stuff...
 * JConnekt Support Single SignnOn and Single SignOut between JConnekt ExApps and Joomla
 * In order to achieve that when you are login or logout in ExApps you've to use customized login system which is shown in the section below
 * These SSO is achieved using OpenID like technology

===  Central Authentication System ===
 * JConnekt has a Joomla based Central Authenticating System but it's flexible enough allow users from the ExApps to authenticating using this system
 * That means authentication is based Joomla but you can login to ExApp1 with the user-account at ExApp2 with this system

 * In future more to come.. and you can create your own using JConnekt ExApp API .. (which will be comming soon)

=== User Groups Mapping ===

we do the user-group mapping by divinding them into two groups. 
 # incoming - for the incoming users (like update/create from exApp)
 # outgoing - for the outgoing users (when existing joomla users logged-into into exApp)

NOTE: Owner of the user's user group for particular user cannot be changed by other exApp or Joomla!
